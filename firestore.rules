/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public profile information for a user.
 * - /users/{userId}/applications/{applicationId}: Stores job application data owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read, create, update, or delete their own data.
 * - Listing documents in the top-level `/users` collection is disallowed.
 * - All subcollections (like `applications`) inherit the ownership model of the parent `/users/{userId}` document.
