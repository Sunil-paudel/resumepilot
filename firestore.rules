/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for resumes, job descriptions,
 * resume analyses, generated resumes, cover letters, and follow-up emails.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. Listing other user's documents is disallowed.
 * - User profiles can only be created by the user themselves, and the userId in the document
 *   must match the authenticated user's ID.
 * - All subcollections inherit the ownership of the parent /users/{userId} document.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is present in all subcollection documents to avoid `get()` calls and enforce
 * ownership.
